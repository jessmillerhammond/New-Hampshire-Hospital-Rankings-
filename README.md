An Analysis of 2015 Hospital Discharge Data


To asses cost of care for hospitals in New Hampshire, expense related metrics were created through summary and descriptive statistics for 
Inpatient and Outpatient Hospital Discharge Data.  To create a schema that compares hospitals that are similar, data was gathered from the 
American Hospital Directory (AHD) website ("https://www.ahd.com).  

The AHD provides data on over 7000 hospitals int he United States including key characteristics, services provided, utilization statistics,
and financial information.  Information including Available Beds, Gross Patient Revenue, Total Revenue, Total Number of Discharges and Type
of Facility was compiled for each NH hospital.  A correlation matrix was calculated to identify how correlated te hospital attributes were.
Highly correlated attributes were dropped, and the following criteria were used to identify which hospitals are similar to each other 
based on the following attributes:

Available Beds, Total Revenue, Net Income, and Type of Facility (Short Term Acute Care or Critical Access).  

K-Means Cluster Analysis was completed.    A K of 3 was chosen, which will cluster the 26 hospitals into three distinct groups.   


New Hampshire Hospital Discharge Data (HDD) was used for the analysis.  HDDcontains inpatient and outpatient hospital discharge data 
that is collected and reported to the NH Department of Health and Human Services.   
HDD contains patient-level discharge information from all hospitals licensed in 
New Hampshire.  HDD is a publicly available dataset used by public health officials and health care planners for the purposes of 
assessing hospital utilization as well as the incidence and burden of disease and injury among New Hampshire residents.
